    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <img src="static/Adversor.jpg" alt="Adversor logo" />
    <p><em>Adversor</em> was founded in late 2015 by <strong>Dado</strong> who recruited his brother <strong>Ja</strong>, on
      drums and <strong>Aurora</strong> on lead guitar.
      <strong>Ema</strong> joined the band shortly after and the band headed directly to the recording studio to produce
      their 2 time sold out demo <em>"Beware Of The Soothsayer"</em>.
      The young band released their <em>"Rise To Survive"</em> debut album in October 2016 under the <em>“Punishment 18 Records”</em> label. The new album which was
      greatly welcomed by fans and critics.
      In 2016 and 2017 they toured Europe to promote RTS.
      After the tour <strong>Aurora</strong> parted ways with Adversor and she was replaced by <strong>Phil</strong> at lead
      guitar.
      In a few months the band got back in the studio to record the its second album <em>"The End Of Mankind"</em> which turned to be a
      good success from critics and fans.
      The band then embarked on a long tour through Europe and got the chance to play in the UK for the first time.
      In November 2018, after their second European Tour supporting <em>"The End Of Mankind"</em>, Ema decided to quit the
      band and was replaced by <strong>Ale</strong>.
      The band continued to tour non stop in 2018 and 2019 gaining more fans show after show. <em>Adversor</em> also played some important shows supporting 
      renowned acts in the metal scene such as <em>Exciter</em>, <em>Protector</em>, <em>Nifelheim</em>, <em>Gama Bomb</em> and many more.

    <h3>Portrait Of A Wasteland, a new chapter..</h3>
    <p>
      <em>Portrait Of A Wasteland</em> represents a journey through some of the darkest moments a person can ever experience:
      suffering, anxiety, grief, frustration, barren dreams, denied future without forgetting a ferocious critic to a
      rotten society, clearly drowning into a spiral of extremisms.
      Ten raging tracks of pure metal that define a new chapter for the band, displaying a more mature sound mixing
      Thrash, Death, Black and classical Heavy. Vitriolic lyrics, razor-sharp riffs, neckwrecking parts are what
      Portrait Of A Wasteland is made of.
